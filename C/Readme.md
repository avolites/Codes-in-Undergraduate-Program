## About this directory
- C language is the first programming language I have leanred when I was an undergraduate. In fact, I had learned fundamentals of Pascal before undergraduate.
- Some codes are in low-quality, for I did not know how to write good codes at that time.
- I took off my study in first year due to pyhsical conditions, so I could not take the exam. One experiment course failed. I just finished retaking recently.
